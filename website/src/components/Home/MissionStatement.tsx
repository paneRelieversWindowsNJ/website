          At Basslines Sportfishing, our philosophy is to provide a comfortable
          great charter boat, with top-notch customer service, and an experience
          of a lifetime each and every trip. We are a charter out of Manasquan
          New Jersey as well as in the Raritan Bay. We offer Off-shore and
          In-Shore Trips, and target a variety of species. We specialize in
          trophy striped bass fishing in the spring and fall, in addition to
          offshore tuna fishing in the summer.
